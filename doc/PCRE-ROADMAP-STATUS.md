# PCRE roadmap status

Reviewed after merged PR225, with PR226 in progress. Issue7 remains the delivery roadmap; the
[syntax matrix](PCRE-SYNTAX-ACCEPTANCE-MATRIX.md),
[resource contract](PCRE-RESOURCE-ERROR-CONTRACT.md) and
[Grep fixture inventory](PCRE-GREP-CONSUMER-FIXTURES.md) define the detailed gates.

## Present position

The internal byte/UTF8 matcher implements ordered alternatives, captures and
backreferences, recursive subroutines, atomic/non-atomic assertions, bounded
variable lookbehind, conditions, repetition, newline policies, malformed-UTF
fragments and guarded resource/cancellation behavior. The observed Grep fixture
floor is mapped, and component correctness/performance probes run in CI. These
are substantial implementation milestones, not an unrestricted PCRE2 claim.
PRs147–205 principally expanded native start-optimization/CRLF entry parity;
issue102 still tracks the wider optimizer gap. PR206 accelerated Intel CI while
retaining each framework's complete suite and frozen-result qualification.

## Remaining order

1. **Complete conformance and Unicode data ownership.** General categories
   are pinned to PCRE2 10.48's Unicode17 in PR207. PR208 pins the complete
   default simple-case mapping, closing host-version dependence in that path.
   Continue offsets, resources and malformed-UTF evidence;
   keep native optimizer differences and unsafe native cases explicitly tracked.
2. **Expand deliberate syntax coverage.** Script/script-extension properties are
   implemented in PR209; PR210 completes the native binary/Bidi catalogue and
   PR211 adds atomic grapheme clusters. PR212 adds Perl class algebra; PR213 adds
   UTS#18 activation, PR214 adds script-run groups, PR215 adds scoped ACCEPT and
   PR216 adds no-argument PRUNE; PR217 adds SKIP candidate restart and one bounded
   PRUNE repeat-cache parity proof. PR218 adds scoped COMMIT root termination
   with bounded native first-code-unit entry. PR219 adds no-argument THEN with
   lexical alternation retry and assertion/callee catches. PR220 adds MARK and
   its shorthand with successful-path byte labels on the internal result. PR221
   adds named SKIP using bounded visible MARK history and shared scoped cuts.
   PR222 adds successful labels for named PRUNE/COMMIT/THEN. PR223 adds
   named ACCEPT/FAIL/F using authentic implicit MARK and existing scope exits.
   PR224 adds the CASELESS_RESTRICT prefix through the existing (?r) policy.
   PR225 adds UTF Turkish casing through the shared scalar folding policy.
   PR226 adds caller Python-octal and bare-zero policies to shared numeric parsing.
   UTF code-unit escape,
   remaining directives/verbs/callouts and other matrix gaps require their own
   pinned reference fixtures. Decide any intentional exclusions before release;
   successful compilation must never imply an unsupported construct works.
3. **Finish architecture/API and consumer performance review.** Preserve the
   byte-authoritative contract; complete the planned UTF16 peer/public API
   decisions and realistic workload measurements. Component smoke comparisons
   do not establish command-level equivalence or release readiness.
4. **Publish and migrate consumers, with Grep last.** Qualify the package and
   public compatibility contract, then migrate consumers in the approved order.
   Grep additionally needs command diagnostics/cancellation, benchmark/stress and
   all six-RID packaging/archive/behavior gates. Remove its PCRE.NET runtime only
   after qualification. Keep CommandFramework production ownership until every
   known consumer migration is complete.

## Current increment and next syntax work

PR225 is merged; main43149468277 and scripts43149468312 are green. Its1256
new controls qualified in18 native results,49744 tests/framework, with zero
failures/skips/build warnings/errors.

PR226 adds internal PythonOctal and NoBackslashZero caller options. The shared
numeric parser selects three-digit octals vs complete decimal references,
rejects Python unbraced values>255 and identifies a one-digit zero, preserving
all other escape contexts, typed nodes, widths and matcher behavior. Both
options default false; these names do not introduce pattern-side directives.

The709 cases include688 independently checked native profiles (534 JIT-valid,
154 compile errors), all octets, capture/forward-reference boundaries, classes/
algebra, quotes, scopes, original byte diagnostics, malformed UTF/CRLF offsets,
work/cancellation/resource and ownership controls. Freeze after clean RED676:
149 expected new failures and50304 passes per framework, no earlier/native
literal oracle failures. Earlier references and GNU/frozen35/214/120 remain
fixed. Final qualification requires50453 tests/framework in18 native results
and author review.

Other directives/callouts, failed/partial labels, UTF C, wider optimizer/resources
(#102), UTF16/exported API and realistic consumer/release qualification remain
open. Grep stays last. See PCRE-NUMERIC-ESCAPE-OPTIONS-DESIGN.md and its PLAN.md.
