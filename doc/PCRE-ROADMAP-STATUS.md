# PCRE roadmap status

Reviewed after PR217, with PR218 in progress, 2026-11-11. Issue7 remains the delivery roadmap; the
[syntax matrix](PCRE-SYNTAX-ACCEPTANCE-MATRIX.md),
[resource contract](PCRE-RESOURCE-ERROR-CONTRACT.md) and
[Grep fixture inventory](PCRE-GREP-CONSUMER-FIXTURES.md) define the detailed gates.

## Present position

The internal byte/UTF8 matcher implements ordered alternatives, captures and
backreferences, recursive subroutines, atomic/non-atomic assertions, bounded
variable lookbehind, conditions, repetition, newline policies, malformed-UTF
fragments and guarded resource/cancellation behavior. The observed Grep fixture
floor is mapped, and component correctness/performance probes run in CI. These
are substantial implementation milestones, not an unrestricted PCRE2 claim.
PRs147–205 principally expanded native start-optimization/CRLF entry parity;
issue102 still tracks the wider optimizer gap. PR206 accelerated Intel CI while
retaining each framework's complete suite and frozen-result qualification.

## Remaining order

1. **Complete conformance and Unicode data ownership.** General categories
   are pinned to PCRE2 10.48's Unicode17 in PR207. PR208 pins the complete
   default simple-case mapping, closing host-version dependence in that path.
   Continue offsets, resources and malformed-UTF evidence;
   keep native optimizer differences and unsafe native cases explicitly tracked.
2. **Expand deliberate syntax coverage.** Script/script-extension properties are
   implemented in PR209; PR210 completes the native binary/Bidi catalogue and
   PR211 adds atomic grapheme clusters. PR212 adds Perl class algebra; PR213 adds
   UTS#18 activation, PR214 adds script-run groups, PR215 adds scoped ACCEPT and
   PR216 adds no-argument PRUNE; PR217 adds SKIP candidate restart and one bounded
   PRUNE repeat-cache parity proof. PR218 adds scoped COMMIT root termination
   with bounded native first-code-unit entry. UTF code-unit escape,
   remaining directives/verbs/callouts and other matrix gaps require their own
   pinned reference fixtures. Decide any intentional exclusions before release;
   successful compilation must never imply an unsupported construct works.
3. **Finish architecture/API and consumer performance review.** Preserve the
   byte-authoritative contract; complete the planned UTF16 peer/public API
   decisions and realistic workload measurements. Component smoke comparisons
   do not establish command-level equivalence or release readiness.
4. **Publish and migrate consumers, with Grep last.** Qualify the package and
   public compatibility contract, then migrate consumers in the approved order.
   Grep additionally needs command diagnostics/cancellation, benchmark/stress and
   all six-RID packaging/archive/behavior gates. Remove its PCRE.NET runtime only
   after qualification. Keep CommandFramework production ownership until every
   known consumer migration is complete.

## Current increment and next syntax work

PR217 is merged and its main checks are green. PR218 adds exact no-argument
COMMIT: shared delayed cuts/catches, root search termination, rightmost verb
precedence, selected callee captures and the shared1024-frame budget. A bounded
first-code-unit proof preserves native leading-COMMIT entry (including malformed
UTF lead bytes); one direct preceding COMMIT also qualifies in the existing
literal-PLUS/PRUNE cache proof. General optimizer parity stays issue102.

All150 new reference cases freeze after clean RED653: net8/9/10 compile with
zero warnings/errors,142 missing-feature failures and46505 passes each. The
three redundant InlineData rows caught in attempt652 were removed before that
checkpoint, without changing any unique expectation. Full native CI and author
review remain readiness gates. Named verbs/MARK, THEN, remaining directives/
callouts, UTF code-unit escape, broader optimizer/resource conformance, UTF16/API
and realistic consumer performance/release remain open. Grep stays last;
GNU/BRE/ERE and frozen35/frozen214 stay intact.
